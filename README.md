The objective of this project is to implement an automated lasso regression pipeline
to provide business intelligence for investment in the Ames, IA housing market.

For data preprocessing, please refer to the Data Preprocessing folder
For preliminary data analysis, please refer to the EDA folder
For pipeline automation script, performance analysis, and model interpretation, please refer to Regression Models

Many visualizations use the Plotly library and are not viewable in the standard GitHub viewer. There is an option to view the Jupyter Notebook using NBVIewer. This will enable many of the visulizations.
